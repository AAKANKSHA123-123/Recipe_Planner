# Recipe Calorie Rule

When working with recipes in this project:

**If a recipe has more than 500 calories, it MUST be marked as high-calorie.**

## Implementation

- In `recipes.py`, use the constant `HIGH_CALORIE_THRESHOLD = 500`.
- Set `recipe["is_high_calorie"] = True` when `calories > 500`.
- In `recipes.json`, ensure each recipe has a numeric `calories` field.

## Example

```python
# Rule application in recipes.py
def _apply_high_calorie_rule(recipe: dict) -> dict:
    calories = recipe.get("calories", 0)
    recipe["is_high_calorie"] = calories > 500
    return recipe
```
