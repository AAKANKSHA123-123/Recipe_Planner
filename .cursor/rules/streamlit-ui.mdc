# Streamlit UI Conventions

When editing the Streamlit UI:

- Use `st.session_state` for persistent state (ingredients, meal plan, suggestions).
- Use `on_change` or button callbacks to trigger recipe suggestions when ingredients change.
- Keep layout structured: use `st.columns` for side-by-side content.
- Use `st.subheader` and `st.divider` for clear sections.
- Display high-calorie recipes with a visible indicator (e.g., "🔴 High-calorie").
- Commands "Generate weekly meal plan" and "Export shopping list" should be prominent buttons.
